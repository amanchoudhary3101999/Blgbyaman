        <p>Gurgaon is India's second largest information technology hub and third largest financial and banking hub.[9][10] Gurgaon is also home to one of India's largest medical tourism industries.[11] Despite being India's 56th largest city in terms of population, Gurgaon is the 8th largest city in the country in terms of total wealth.[12] Gurgaon serves as the headquarters of many of India's largest companies, is home to thousands of startup companies and has local offices for more than 250 Fortune 500 companies.[13] It accounts for almost 70% of the total annual economic investments in Haryana state, which has helped it become a leading hub for high-tech industry in northern India.[14] Gurgaon is categorised as very high on the Human Development Index, with an HDI of 0.889 (2017).[15]

            Gurgaon's economic growth started in the 1970s when Maruti Suzuki India Limited established a manufacturing plant and gathered pace after General Electric established its business outsourcing operations in the city in collaboration with real-estate firm DLF.[16][17] New Gurgaon, Manesar and Sohna serve as adjoining manufacturing and upcoming real estate hubs for Gurgaon. Despite rapid economic and population growth, Gurgaon continues to battle socio-economic issues, such as high-income inequality and high air pollution.It also has a flood problem due to the limited drainage capacity.</p>
